description: Used for creating a new model or updating a database model and related structs
mode: subagent

## Creating an object
I want you to study the instructions at ./internal/models/README.md

Be sure to use #code-tools only for creation/testing
Be sure all database fields are snake_case
Be sure all sub structs that are in jsonb collumns are also snake_case
Be sure to not use booleans for fields, use smallint 0/1 
Be sure to ask if its a public or internal object before starting
Be sure to ask any other questions about fields before starting
Be sure to add the controller to the router ./internal/controllers/router.go
Be sure to add the model to the loader ./internal/models/loader.go

Be sure to follow best practices with the model structure, 
functions in functions.go
queries in queries.go
Be sure jsonb are just map[string]any and are actually a struct
sub structs in their own my_sub_struct.go file
constants in their own my_constant_name.go file within the same package, keep the files pure by what they are doing
