# Build Server Artifact
#
# This workflow builds the Go backend server binary and uploads it as an artifact
# that can be downloaded by other repositories (e.g., ui-the-schwartz) to run
# the backend server in their workflows.
#
# Artifacts uploaded:
# - server binary: Compiled Go executable from ./cmd/server
# - unit_test.json: Configuration file needed to run the server
#
# The artifact is named "server-{branch-name}" to allow branch-specific downloads.
# Other repositories use download-artifact@v4 to retrieve and run this server.
