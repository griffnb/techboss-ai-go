## Creating an object
I want you to study the instructions at ./internal/models/README.md

Be sure to use #code-tools only for creation/testing
Be sure all database fields are snake_case
Be sure all sub structs that are in jsonb collumns are also snake_case
Be sure to not use booleans for fields, use smallint 0/1 
Be sure to ask if its a public or internal object before starting
Be sure to ask any other questions about fields before starting

Be sure to follow best practices with the model structure, 
functions in functions.go
queries in queries.go
sub structs in their own my_sub_struct.go file
