- at the top of the test function write a comment //GENERATED BY AI
- Write unit tests in a single function with each conditional test being written in its own t.Run("Condition im looking for")
-  There is a testing service to help generate objects, testing_service.New().WithAccount().WithOrganization() etc, it will help build test objects properly
- use the testing library to assert.Eq(t,got,want,"description"), it uses generics so got and want can be anything
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.
